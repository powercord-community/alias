# Alias Plugin
This is a plugin made for [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord).

It allows you to "bind" text to custom commands, which you then use to send the text as a message (does not trigger commands).  
See the example gif below for details:

## Example
![](Example.gif)

You can use either `.alias <aliasName>` or `.a <aliasName>`.  
Type `.alias` by itself to see a short list of aliases.

## Installation
1. Download with `git clone https://github.com/powercord-community/alias alias`
2. Move `alias` to `Powercord/src/powercord/plugins/` and restart Discord Canary
